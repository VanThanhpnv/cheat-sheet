During these two weeks we are going to work a lot together.

To do that, we will follow the SCRUM method. For the purposes of this presentation we will adapt the method a little (no time tracking in daily, use hours as a metric, avoid speaking english, reduce time of meetings)

# Our adapted SCRUM

## SCRUM Planning

Each week will start with a short Sprint planning.

A SCRUM starts by the planning. During the planning, we will :
 - Give an objective to the Sprint
 - Count available hours of work
 - Multiply it by focus factor (we will start with a focus factor of 1)
 - After a short presentation of each task, we will estimate the number of hour/man needed on it. We do this until no more hours are available.

## Every day work

### Daily meeting

Each practical work starts with a daily.

Every one prepare it during 5 minutes. On a paper, he writes in vietnamese or in engish what he did during the last practical work, and what he plans to do during this one. Also, difficulties will be mentionned.

We then read the notes.

The SCRUM master updates the burndown chart from the information people reported to him.

### Working time

We will be doing pair programming. All students should be in pair. Two man, one keyboard. Only one people uses the keyboard at the same time.

Every hour, the SCRUM master will give the signal to change. The one coaching now writes things on the keyboard. And the one with the keyboard becomes the coach.

Once done with one ticket, you should open a review on Github (see below). It will get reviewed by other students, the SCRUM master and the over students. Please also ask SCRUM master for review.

Please don't take new ticket until the review is validated. While waiting, you can review other people reviews.

Once your review is approuved, you can take a new ticket on the board.

## SCRUM Review

First we will count the number of point scored. We will adapt the focus factor.

Then we will see if the objective of the Sprint is done.

If applicable, we will have a small DEMO.

Every one then takes 5 minutes (in Vietnamese or english) to write 2 positive and 2 negative things about what appened this week. We will then read it.

Then, from what people described, we will write two advices about how to improve ourselves for the next week.
